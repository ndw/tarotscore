<h1>Tarot Scoring</h1>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>>Tarot is a French trick-taking card game. There are variations for
three, four, or five players. Play requires a special deck of cards
with 21 trumps, four suits of 14 cards, and a fool. I'll leave the
rest to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_tarot">Wikipedia
page</a>.
</p>

<p>It's a fun game, but, <em>holy crap</em>, the scoring is
complicated! Given that we usually play after a couple of cocktails,
often too complicated.</p>

<p>The answer, clearly, is a web app to do the scoring! Welll, we all
thought that was the clear answer, especially if I was tapped to write
it. So here it is.</p>
