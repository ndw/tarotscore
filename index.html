<h1>Tarot Scoring</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Tarot is a French trick-taking card game. There are variations for
three, four, or five players. Play requires a special deck of cards
with 21 trumps, four suits of 14 cards, and a fool. I'll leave the
rest to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_tarot">Wikipedia
page</a>.
</p>

<p>It's a fun game, but, <em>holy crap</em>, the scoring is
complicated! Given that we usually play after a couple of cocktails,
often too complicated.</p>

<p>The answer, clearly, is a web app to do the scoring! Well,
<em>we</em> all thought that was the clear answer, especially if I was
tapped to write it. So here it is.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="score4.html">Tarot scoring for four players</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Yeah it really is just that pretty. You're welcome to contribute
your favorite <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Zen Garden</a>
stylesheets.)</p>

<p>I haven't written the apps for three or five players yet, sorry.
I'm open to requests, however. I expect when we have a chance to play
with five players, I'll write that one.</p>

<p>I also have plans to implement this as an “offline” app at some point.
I'm open to requests for that too.</p>

<p>Share and enjoy!</p>

<p>P.S. This is my attempt to implement
<a href="http://www.pagat.com/tarot/frtarot.html">a particular</a> set of
rules. Suggestions for different rules are welcome as well.</p>
